The player is the orange rectangle that can be controlled by th wasd key.
The frog(dark blue rectangle) chases the player and try to steal its meatballs
The meatballs are the rectangles placed around the map(This will be randoized in future implentation)
The invisibility collectible is the dark green rectangle, makes the payer invisible to the frog for some time, the frog is stationary while this is active.

Yellow obstacles can be jumped over by pressing "a" and the direction you want to go.
The remaining number of meatball left to be collected is represented using "m"
The number of meatballs with the playeris represented by "E" and 
the number of stolen meatballs is represented by "st". when the frog comes in contact with the player(if the player currently has a meatball), it steals a meatball and stays stationary while it eats it.
The game ends when all meatball has been collected.
the player wins if they have more meatballs than the frog and loses if the frog has more meatballs. 

---After milestone 3
you can collect portals(yellow square), if you you collide with a portal and press "b" later, you teleport to the closest meatball (using the manhattan distance). you can do this only once
the game now has 3 levels, after the third level you have the option to repeat (if you dare) but with a slightly faster frog. after finishing the 3 stages with the fast frog you completely win the game
